This folder contains a number of exercises with which you can train composite
types as `enum` and `structs`.

To get started, run:

```bash
cargo run --bin 01
```

This will try to compile exercise 1. Try and get the example to run, and
continue on with the next exercise by replacing the number of the exercise in
the cargo run command.

Some exercises contain unit tests. To run the test in `src/bin/01.rs`, run

```bash
cargo test --bin 01
```

Make sure all tests pass!
