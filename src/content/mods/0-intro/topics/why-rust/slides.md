# How to choose a language

What characteristics do you want?
<!-- Try asking the audience first -->

<v-click>

1. Efficiency          <!-- not just fast code, also saving the planet -->
2. Safety              <!-- preventing mistakes, but also failing gracefully -->
3. Elegance            <!-- this is not a subjective quality -->
4. Practical relevance <!-- this excludes favourite toy languages -->

Most languages tick two of these boxes, if you are lucky you get three.

# Rust comes with a warranty

- Strong type system helps prevent silly bugs
- Explicit errors instead of exceptions
- Type system tracks lifetime of objects
	* No more *"null pointer exception"*
- Programs don't trash your system accidentally
	* Warranty *can* be voided (`unsafe`)

*"If it compiles, it is more often correct."*
