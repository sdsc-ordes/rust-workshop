# ü¶Ä Rust Workshop - From Python to Rust - Fundamentals

SDSC is organizing a 2nd round of an "Introduction to Rust" workshop and we have
some extra seats for anyone in the RSE community who would like to join
(remotely). If you're interested, write an email to
[gabriel.nuetzi@sdsc.ethz.ch](mailto:gabriel.nuetzi@sdsc.ethz.ch) (Subject:
`Rust Workshop Registration`). We will accept participants in a first come first
serve basis and you will be invited to the Zoom Meetings and temporary Slack
Channel for the Workshop.

## Target Audience

- Anybody interested in learning Rust, if you know Python you should be fine!

- If you **already have Rust Experience** and want to jump in later you can of
  course do that: The slides are
  [here](https://sdsc-ordes.github.io/technical-presentation/gh-pages/rust-workshop/part-1/#/title-slide).
  I will announce the status after each session in the Slack Channel.

  It is also very helpful to help out in the exercise session or during the
  presentation: answering questions in the Slack channel or doing some
  one-to-one calls directly **that would be wonderful**. Please reach out to me:
