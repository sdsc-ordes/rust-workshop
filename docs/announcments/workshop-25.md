# ü¶Ä Rust Workshop - From Python to Rust - Fundamentals

We at SDSC ETH Zurich conduct a Rust Workshop (2nd time), and I think I can
still fit some people from the **RSE community** who like to join (its remote).
Write me an email at
[gabriel.nuetzi@sdsc.ethz.ch](mailto:gabriel.nuetzi@sdsc.ethz.ch) (Subject:
`Rust Workshop Registration`). **First come first serves.** You will be invited
to the Zoom Meetings and temporary Slack Channel for the Workshop.

## Target Audience

- Anybody interested in learning Rust, if you know Python you should be fine!

- If you **already have Rust Experience** and want to jump in later you can of
  course do that: The slides are
  [here](https://sdsc-ordes.github.io/technical-presentation/gh-pages/rust-workshop/part-1/#/title-slide).
  I will announce the status after each session in the Slack Channel.

  It is also very helpful to help out in the exercise session or during the
  presentation: answering questions in the Slack channel or doing some
  one-to-one calls directly **that would be wonderful**. Please reach out to me:
  (Subject: `Rust Workshop Contrib`).

## ‚öíÔ∏èPreliminaries

I need your help to prepare your awesome DevSetup with some Rust stuff:

**[Follow these instructions](https://github.com/sdsc-ordes/rust-workshop#preliminaries)**

**You must have the setup completed before attending the workshop, we don't fix
issues at the workshop.** You should choose either the DevContainer setup or the
Nix setup.

Please reach out if something is not working and if you have trouble using it!
PRs on typos/fixes in this repo are welcome! You dont need to look at the
exercises yet,
